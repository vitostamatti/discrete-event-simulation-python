## About <a name = "about"></a>

I noticed that there are not so many examples of semi-complex discrete event
simulation models made with python and simpy so I decided to create this repo
to share some of my own experiments.

## Usage <a name = "about"></a>

Just opening any of the notebooks in google colab and try them. If you 
found useful some implementation, let me know. 

Make sure you install simpy before running anything.

```
pip install simpy
```

## Roadmap

- [X] First commit.
- [ ] Finish notebooks examples.
