## About <a name = "about"></a>

I realized that there aren't many examples of semi-complex discrete event 
simulation models made with python and simpy, so I decided to create this 
repository to share some of my own experiments.

## Usage <a name = "about"></a>

Just by opening any of the notebooks in google colab and try them. If you 
found useful some implementation, let me know. 

Make sure you install simpy before running anything.

```
pip install simpy
```

The examples are kind of ordered from least to most elaborate.

1. [Basic Examples](/notebooks/01-basic_examples.ipynb)
2. [Transportation Examples](/notebooks/02-transportation.examples.ipynb)
3. [Entity Flow Examples](/notebooks/03-entity_flow_examples.ipynb)
4. [Fuel Station Example](/notebooks/04-fuel_station_example.ipynb)


## Roadmap

- [X] First commit.
- [ ] Finish notebooks examples.
